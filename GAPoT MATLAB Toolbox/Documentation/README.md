# GaPoTNumLib MATLAB Toolbox

## GaPoTNumLib MATLAB Toolbox is a MATLAB library that integrates a branch of Mathematics: Geometric Algebra (GA).

In the field of electrical engineering, GA is becoming very popular. This branch introduces new mathematical operators: the outer product and the geometric product, which groups the outer and inner product. The scalar or inner product of two vectors (σ1,σ2) is used in other algebras, so it is widely known. Its result is a scalar. On the other hand, the outer product of two vectors (which must also be non-coincident) results in a new mathematical object: the biversor (σ12), which will represent a plane. The outer product between vectors and biversors will generate elements of higher dimensionality: the trivectors (and generically, multivectors).

All this has direct application in electrical engineering. In this field, we work with several dimensions. For example: in a three-phase circuit of an industrial installation, the three existing phases must be studied, as well as the different harmonics that appear, derived from non-sinusoidal consumptions. The application of geometric algebra in this aspect offers a fundamental advantage, compared to the application of traditional Circuit Theory: Each phase and harmonic is kept independent, which solves aspects such as the interpretation of Budeanu with the presence of harmonics.

The GaPoTNumLib MATLAB Toolbox, developed by Dr. Ahmad H. Eid, from Port-Said University (Egypt), aims to introduce in MALTAB the tools offered by GA for use, among others, in the electrical field.

This paper, under the supervision of Dr. Francisco G. Montoya (University of Almeria) will describe the new functionalities of GaPoTNumLib MATLAB Toolbox. In addition, the solving of several electrical circuits will be presented:

* A single-phase circuit (without harmonics).
* A three-phase circuit (without harmonics)
* A three-phase circuit (with harmonics)

In this way, the aim is to learn more about the library and its practical application.
