## About GAPoTNumLib
Geometric Algebra has gained a lot of attention recently. The use of this framework in electrical and power systems has been introduced by the GAPoT theory. However, a powerful and flexible tool is needed in order to manage the large number of dimensions potentially required to deal with systems where a high number of harmonics are present. GAPoTNumLib is such a tool. Thanks to its design and architecture it is able to provide the necessary capabilities to perform electrical circuit analysis as well as to evaluate power and energy flow computations. Typically, geometric algebra software libraries are designed for manipulating general multivectors. This constraint is not necessary for GAPoT computations, which only need to deal with grade 0,1,2 sparse multivectors. This allows for efficient storage and processing of multivector coefficients.
